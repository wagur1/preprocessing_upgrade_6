"""Task-importance spatial mask (upgrade3, contribution A2).

upgrade2 could only trade in-domain gain for real-codec transfer with a GLOBAL
knob (``gamma`` on total variation): every pixel was pushed to be cheap-to-encode
equally, so cutting background bits also blurred the object the analyzer needs.
A2 makes that trade-off **spatial**: spend the edit/rate budget where the frozen
task network actually looks, and aggressively smooth everywhere else.

The importance map is a **gradient saliency** of the task loss w.r.t. the input
pixels -- exactly "which pixels move the machine's decision":

    m(x) = normalise( | d L_task / d x | ),   detached.

It is computed with a single extra backward through the *frozen* analyzer and
then **detached**, so it only *reweights* the preprocessor's penalties -- no
second-order gradient flows into the preprocessor, keeping training stable and
cheap. This is the pixel-domain analogue of task-driven / wrapper-aware bit
allocation (Reinforced Bit Allocation, arXiv:1910.07392; feature-preserving RDO,
arXiv:2504.02216) and ROI retargeting for machines (EURASIP JIVP 2025), but as a
differentiable loss weight rather than an encoder-side QP map.

Contract: input video ``[B,C,T,H,W]`` in [0,1] -> mask ``[B,1,T,H,W]`` in [0,1],
1 = task-critical (protect), 0 = ignorable (smooth hard).
