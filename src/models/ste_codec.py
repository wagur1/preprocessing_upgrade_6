"""Real-codec-in-the-loop straight-through wrapper (upgrade3, contribution A3).

upgrade2 trained *entirely* through a differentiable proxy (CompressAI or the
block-DCT virtual codec) and hoped the edit transferred to x264/x265. Its own
report shows the transfer stalling near break-even -- the proxy's rate/quant
geometry simply is not the deployment codec's.

The most reliable fix in the literature is **run the real codec in the forward
pass and borrow the proxy's gradient in the backward pass** (straight-through):
Lu et al. (arXiv:2206.05650) measured forward-real-codec at BD-Rate -20.3% vs
-14.6% for a proxy used in *both* directions. This wrapper implements exactly
that so the loss the optimiser sees is computed on the TRUE x264/x265
reconstruction and TRUE coded bpp, while gradients still flow to the
preprocessor through the differentiable proxy:

    x_hat = x_proxy + (x_real  - x_proxy).detach()      # value=real, grad=proxy
    bpp   = bpp_proxy + (bpp_real - bpp_proxy).detach()

Because ffmpeg runs per step this is ~10-50x slower than proxy-only training and
is meant as a **short calibration fine-tune** on top of a proxy-pretrained
checkpoint (see configs/universal_action_recognition.yaml -> stage 2), not for
training from scratch. ``quality -> qp`` inversion lets it slot into the engine's
existing ``codec(x, quality)`` call unchanged.
