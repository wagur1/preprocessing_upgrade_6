"""Training objective for the machine-vision video preprocessor (upgrade2).

    L = lam_task * L_task + omega * L_distill + beta * L_rate + tau * L_temp
        (+ delta * L_delta) (+ gamma * L_tv) (+ mu * L_D)

By default there is **no MSE-to-source distortion term**. That term (the
baseline's ``L_D``) pins the reconstruction to the original pixels; against a
codec-*mismatched* proxy (our CompressAI wavelet transform) it fought
compression, which is why that setup never reached negative BD-Rate. Following
Yang et al. (TCSVT 2024) the default objective replaces pixel fidelity with a
*task-aligned* feature distillation term and lets a real rate weight bite.

Zhao et al. (arXiv:2512.15331), however, KEEP ``L_D`` heavily weighted (alpha=10)
with a light rate weight and still win on real block-DCT codecs. So ``L_D`` is
available as an optional ``mu`` term -- enable it together with the
block-transform virtual codec (``codec.kind: virtual``), where pinning pixels is
in the *same* domain as x264/x265 rather than fighting a wavelet proxy.

  * ``L_task``   : accuracy loss from the frozen analyzer on the reconstruction
                   (cross-entropy for recognition; SiamFC logistic for tracking).
  * ``L_distill``: MSE between the frozen analyzer's intermediate features on the
                   *source* and on the *reconstruction* -- keeps semantics the
                   codec would otherwise destroy (helps most at low bitrate).
  * ``L_rate``   : estimated bits-per-pixel from the codec entropy model.
  * ``L_temp``   : temporal consistency -- match the *inter-frame change* of the
                   reconstruction to that of the source. Preserves motion / kills
                   flicker without pinning absolute pixels (the video novelty).
  * ``L_delta``  : (optional, off by default) L1 magnitude of the preprocessor's
                   pixel edit ``|x_pre - x|``. A direct edit-sparsity lever when
                   the rate term alone won't stop the edit adding bits. NOT
                   MSE-to-source: it constrains the *input* edit, not x_hat.
  * ``L_tv``     : (optional, off by default) total variation of the preprocessor
                   output ``x_pre``. A *codec-agnostic* bit-cost proxy: every real
                   codec (DCT/wavelet/block) spends bits on spatial high-frequency
                   energy, so penalising TV pushes cheap-to-encode-on-ANY-codec
                   frames -- the lever for transfer to x264/x265 (unlike beta*bpp,
                   which only reduces the *proxy* codec's bits). L_task keeps the
                   edges the machine actually needs.
  * ``L_D``      : (optional, off by default) MSE between reconstruction and
                   source ``||x_hat - x||^2``. Zhao et al.'s distortion term; use
                   it with the block-transform virtual codec (mu ~ 10, light beta).
