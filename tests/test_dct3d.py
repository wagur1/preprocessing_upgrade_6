"""Checks for the 3-D (spatio-temporal) adaptive DCT term (`kappa_t`, src/losses.py).

The 2-D term flattens time into the batch, so it is structurally blind to temporal
frequency, and the model was measured escaping into exactly that axis: added spatial
HF fell +24.2% -> +6.9% under kappa while TVt/RMS ROSE 0.4931 -> 0.6964. The same
evasion appeared independently on gamma_res (temporal share 37.2% -> 42.8%).

Note on the spec these tests implement: "alternating-sign residual -> penalty
maximal" is only true for residuals that also carry SPATIAL high frequency. A
spatially flat field that flips sign every frame is spatial-DC, and the v1 band mask
deliberately leaves that cell unpenalised (the documented scope hole). The tests
below pin the corrected property.
